# 2 - Supervised Learning

This project uses the most popular classification techniques to predict the outcomes after an extensive EDA and work missing values, and imbalance in data. This project has two parts: 

  - Part 1 - Predicting the condition of the patient depending on the received test results on biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. 
  - Part 2 - Build an AIML model to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical database.

### Skills and Tools
  - Logistic Regression, 
  - Naive Bayes, 
  - KNN, 
  - Classification


# 3 - Ensemble Techniques

The project was accomplished by deploying a GUI powered by supervised learning and ensemble modelling techniques to build and train a prediction model for a telecom company. This will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This will enable the company to understand and pinpoints the patterns of customer churn and increase the focus on customer retention strategies.
